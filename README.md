 Distributed Network Slicing Platform

A distributed computing prototype designed to demonstrate the creation, management, monitoring, processing, and coordination of network slices across multiple computational nodes. The platform is being developed as an evolving telecommunications-oriented distributed system using a controller-worker architecture.

The current implementation focuses on the first four milestones of the project: Distributed Operating System Foundation, Distributed Processing and Performance, Distributed Architecture, and Distributed Algorithms and Coordination.

🖥️ Distributed Node Resource Allocation Blueprint — Milestone 1 Foundation

The initial distributed environment uses three Ubuntu virtual machines running under Oracle VM VirtualBox. The nodes form the computational foundation of the platform.

🏢 1. Controller / Master Node (master)

Role: Distributed Controller / Scheduler / Resource Manager

Operating System: Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS

IP Address: 192.168.2.113

Hostname: master

Primary Responsibilities:

Network-slice request handling

Worker selection and scheduling

Resource allocation

Distributed coordination

Performance monitoring

🖥️ 2. Worker Node 1 (node1)

Role: Distributed computation / task execution node

Operating System: Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS

IP Address: 192.168.2.110

Hostname: node1

Primary Responsibilities:

Process execution

Slice resource allocation

CPU and memory monitoring

Distributed workload processing

🖥️ 3. Worker Node 2 (node2)

Role: Distributed computation / task execution node

Operating System: Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS

IP Address: 192.168.2.111

Hostname: node2

Primary Responsibilities:

Process execution

Slice resource allocation

CPU and memory monitoring

🌐 Network Communication

The three virtual machines communicate through the local network using IP connectivity and hostname resolution.

Application-level communication is implemented using REST/HTTP rather than relying on SSH as the system control-plane mechanism.

🛠️ Milestone 1 — Distributed Operating System Foundation

Milestone 1 establishes the computational foundation of the distributed platform.

Implemented Concepts

Multiple computational nodes

Controller-worker architecture

Inter-node REST communication

Process creation

Basic process scheduling

Resource allocation

CPU and memory monitoring

Logical representation of network slices

Network Slice Resource Model

A slice request is represented using:

Slice ID
CPU requirement
Memory requirement
Bandwidth requirement
Priority

The controller evaluates worker resource availability and selects an eligible worker using resource-aware scheduling.

📊 Milestone 2 — Distributed Processing and Performance

Milestone 2 extends the prototype by distributing computational workloads across multiple worker nodes and measuring system performance.

Performance Metrics

The platform records:

Throughput

Latency

Jitter

Packet loss / task failure rate

CPU utilization

Memory utilization

Worker load distribution

Performance Calculations

Throughput

Throughput = Completed Tasks / Total Execution Time

Latency

Latency = Response Time - Request Time

Jitter

The prototype estimates jitter using the statistical variation of measured response times.

Packet Loss / Failure Rate

Failure Rate (%) =
(Failed Tasks / Total Tasks) × 100

Results

Performance results are automatically stored in:

results/milestone_results.json

This provides a structured dataset that can later be used for further analysis and visualization.

📐 Milestone 3 — Distributed Architecture Design

Milestone 3 transforms the initial prototype into a more clearly separated distributed architecture.

Architectural Components

The platform separates responsibilities into:

Client/API interface

Controller

Slice Manager

Scheduler

Resource Manager

Worker Services

Resource Monitoring

Coordination

Deployment Architecture

The current design can be represented as:

                 CLIENT
                    |
                    v
             CORE / CONTROLLER
          +---------------------+
          | Slice Manager       |
          | Scheduler           |
          | Resource Manager    |
          | Coordinator         |
          +----------+----------+
                     |
              +------+------+
              |             |
              v             v
           EDGE          EDGE
         WORKER 1      WORKER 2

Architectural Evolution

The architecture provides a foundation for future development toward an Edge ↔ Core ↔ Cloud model.

The controller performs centralized coordination and scheduling, while computational tasks are distributed to worker nodes closer to the execution layer.

🕒 Milestone 4 — Distributed Algorithms and Coordination

Milestone 4 introduces mechanisms for coordination and distributed state management.

1. Distributed Coordination

The platform demonstrates coordination between the controller and worker nodes through application-level messages.

2. Leader Election

A lightweight leader-election demonstration is implemented to identify a coordination leader among participating nodes.

The current implementation is intended as a prototype of the coordination concept and can later be replaced by a more robust distributed consensus algorithm.

3. Logical Clocks

A Lamport-style logical clock is used to demonstrate distributed event ordering.

The basic rules are:

1. Before a local event:
   L = L + 1

2. When receiving a message with timestamp T:
   L = max(L, T) + 1

This allows distributed events to be ordered without depending exclusively on synchronized physical clocks.

4. Coordination Measurements

The prototype records:

Coordination messages

Logical clock values

Synchronization delay

Distributed event acknowledgements

🧪 Live Demonstration

The complete local prototype can be executed from VS Code.

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Demonstration

python run_demo.py

The demonstration automatically starts:

Controller
Worker 1
Worker 2

and executes demonstrations corresponding to Milestones 1–4.

Expected output includes:

MILESTONE 1: ✓ distributed foundation
MILESTONE 2: ✓ throughput / latency / jitter / packet loss
MILESTONE 3: ✓ distributed architecture
MILESTONE 4: ✓ leader election / logical clock

Detailed experimental results are saved to:
